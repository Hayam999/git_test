Sometimes i tell myself whether i wanna quit the path of programming that i've chosing it 3 years ago
because it's really frustrating and i feel that i'm alone in this place with no one
care for me or for my progress, no one is there to share my pain with or to be happy about
what we are learning
or maybe it's just not for me, maybe something else maybe mine and will enjoy it as i go
maybe it's the reason for the gap between me an my family 
maybe i will never be able to earn a dollar 
maybe i will still open courses and let it with out completion
or maybe i will still taking courses without any actual progress
or maybe i'll be able to make projects but fail in branding myself
and much more reasons that makes me think about stopping this path that i chose to myself

But when i remember that there is a possibility that i'll be 
_ financially independent
_ Have the freedom to buy whatever I want
_ Make an Important position in my family because i made what i was planning for and
_ Have money to make our lives better
_ when i remember that by programming i'll be interacthing with people from all over the world
_ and i can possibly make friends out of those professional relationships
_ when i remember that maybe some day i'll travel and expirence the magic of this journey
 I come back to my self again and remember that i've no other choice 
 and i will never repeat my previous mistake again 
 Never
